USBGuard is a software framework for implementing USB device authorization policies (what kind of USB devces are authorized) as well as method of use policies (how a USB device may interact with the system).

Features include:

* Rule-based policy engine based on a simple, human-readable rule language
* Daemon component with an IPC interface for dynamic interaction and policy enforcement
* Command line and graphical user interface
* D-Bus API
* C++ API including IPC client implemented in a shared library

== Supported Operating Systems

Currently, USBGuard works only on Linux.
To enforce the user-defined policy, USBGuard uses the USB device authorization feature implemented in the Linux kernel since the year 2007.
